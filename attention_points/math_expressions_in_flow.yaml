summary: Mathematical expressions are part of flowing text
labels: [math, writing, style]
description: |
  Mathematical expressions should be part of the flowing text, even if the
  expression is displayed and not in-line. This means in particular that
  punctuation rules must be followed. So never end a sentence before an
  expression and keep it hanging.

  An example:

  > The quantites $a$ and $b$ are inversely proportional; namely
  > $$a=\gamma\frac{1}{b},$$
  > where $\gamma$ is a proportionality constant.
