summary: Font style for mathematical symbols follows the standard
labels: [math, notation]

  The typeface for mathematical symbols are [standardized][msfs.standardized] to
  avoid confusion with, e.g., symbols for units, and to distinguish variables
  and constants. Often, these conventions are not followed. Sometimes the
  conventions are followed in equations, but not in the text, creating a
  situation where two typographically distinct symbols are used for the same
  thing. Basically, the standard tells us to write

  * variables and quantities in italic (or at least slanted), and
  * mathematical constants, units, and descriptive terms in roman (or at least
    upright).

  Some examples:

  * The value of the mathematical constant $\mathrm{e}$ is approximately $2.72$.
  * The established value for the electron charge $e$—a physical constant but
    mathematical variable—is approximately $1.6\cdot10^{-19}~\textrm{C}$.
  * The function generically denoted by $f$ is here defined for all real-values
    $x$ by $f(x)=x^2+1$.
  * We will need the coefficients $c_{\text{dry}}$ and $c_{\text{wet}}$.
  * Is the sum $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{k}$ well-defined?
