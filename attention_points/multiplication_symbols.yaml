summary: Multiplication symbols use consistent; asterisk ($*$) not abused

  There is a difference between symbols used in programming languages and those
  in written texts. The former are essentially constrained by the keys available
  on keyboards, the latter are not. This is especially relevant for
  multiplication symbols:

  * standard multiplication does not always need to be indicated using a symbol,
    juxtaposition may be enough ($ab$);
  * $\cdot$ can be used for the scalar product (inner product) of vectors
    ($\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}$) or for standard multiplication ($1.6\cdot10^6$);
  * $\times$ is used for multiplication (Cartesian product) of sets
    ($\mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{D}$), (outer) vector product
    ($\vec{u}\times\vec{v}$), or standard multiplication ($1.6\times10^6$);
  * $*$ is used for convolution of functions ($f*g$) and never for standard
    multiplication.

  In any case, usage must be consistent.
