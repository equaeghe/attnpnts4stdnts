summary: Only significant digits of numbers given
labels: [number]

  The number of digits shown in a text should not be arbitrary. For example, it
  should not be based on the number of digits output from a computation tool.
  Only the significant digits should be shown. If the number of significant
  digits is difficult to determine: showing fewer is better than showing more
  and any significant digit (certainly beyond the second) should be justified.
