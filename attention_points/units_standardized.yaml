summary: Unit notation follows the standard (upright, preceded by space)
labels: [notation]
description: >
  The notation for units is [standardized] as well; they should be written in
  roman (or at least upright). The positioning of units is also standardized;
  they should be separated from the value by a single—non-breaking—space (apart
  from a few [exceptions]).

  Some examples:

  * The temperature of $-273.15~\mathrm{K}$ is equal to $0~°\mathrm{C}$.
  * Delft lies as a latitude of $52°\,00′\,24″$ North and a longitude of
    $4°\,21′\,20″$ East.

    must-use package)
