summary: Unit notation follows the standard (upright, preceded by space)
labels: [notation]
description: |
  The notation for units is [standardized][us.standardized] as well; they should
  be written in roman (or at least upright). The positioning of units is also
  standardized; they should be separated from the value by a
  single—non-breaking—space (apart from a few [exceptions][us.exceptions]).

  Some examples:

  * The temperature of $-273.15~\mathrm{K}$ is equal to $0~^\circ\mathrm{C}$.
  * Delft lies as a latitude of $52^\circ\,00'\,24''$ North and a longitude of
    $4^\circ\,21'\,20''$ East.

    (normally already included in a standard installation; I consider this a
    must-use package)
