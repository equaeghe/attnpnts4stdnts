  Paragraphs should not be overly long, as this makes it hard to follow the
  argument. There are no hard rules, but paragraphs more than six sentences,
  say, should be _evaluated_ for splitting. (Each of these sentences should of
  course also be of reasonable length; beware the ‘run-on sentence’.)

  Apart from splitting them, there are other ways to fix overly long paragraphs,
  such as

  * using ordered or un-ordered lists, or
  * presenting the content in another way, e.g., using tables or figures.
